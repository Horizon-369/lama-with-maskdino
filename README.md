# lama-with-maskdino
It was inspired by [Auto-Lama](https://github.com/andy971022/auto-lama#readme).

Unlike Auto-Lama, it differs in:
1. Use the object instance segmentation model [MaskDINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/MaskDINO) instead of the object detection model [DETR](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr).
1. Use [Lama with refiner](https://github.com/geomagical/lama-with-refiner) for better results.
